* DB layer accept madlibtestdata.lin_ornstein format table name

DONE * Test the manual format for S4 methods

DONE * Better names for classes

DONE * print & show for db.data.frame

DONE * temp table/view cannot be handled correctly

* Override +-*/ etc 

* Override <>== etc 

* Override sqrt, log, log1p etc 

* colMeans, colSums, colSds

* \concept in doc

DONE * Fix the bug: cannot diconnect any connection before last

* Check db.obj whether the related connection is live

DONE * Allow change conn.id for the connections

DONE * Actually no need to install RPostgreSQL from source

DONE * Change db.data.frame from method to function (data.frame is not generic)

DONE * implement lm and replated summary, print functions

* predict function for lm

* implement glm

* predict function for glm

* Need to use "try" in free functions to prevent leaving temporary tables around

* funtion resync

DONE * as.db.data.frame for data.frame

DONE * as.db.data.frame for file

* implement apply etc

* summary method

DONE * utility function for analyzing formula

* utility function for creating temporary table during fitting db.Rquery objects, need "try"

DONE * utility function for unique string

* Many warnings during build process

DONE * Implement is.db.data.frame

DONE * When writing file to a table, need support for distributed.by and is.temp

DONE * Careful check existsTable when writing to a table

DONE * as.db.data.frame supports putting file into database

DONE * as.db.data.frame supports converting anything to data.frame and then put it into database

DONE * Print verbose when create mapping (db.data.frame) and as.db.data.frame

DONE * Improvement for .db.existsTable when is.temp is TRUE

*** existsTable cannot check view, may need to use .is.table.or.view to check existence for all

YES * Can all arguments included in the generic definition

MAYBE NO NEED * Can arguments in generic function have default values?

DONE * function portion to extract a sample of the data

* function sample

DONE * utility function to set message level

DONE * Error class

DONE * utility function to read input interactively

* Need to check whether id.col is in names() when create db.data.frame

* May need a distributed.by properties for db.obj, useful when creating temp table

* How to deal with NULL, INF, NA etc in the result of linregr

DONE * provide conn function

* provide types function for column types

* provide db.listTables

* provide db.listSchemas

DONE * add a dbms function to print out the DBMS version info

NO WAY TO DO THIS * logistic and multi-logistic dependent variable
should be a factor, R needs to take care of this

DONE * conn_attr utilities all need to validate conn.id

* Can we choose not to expose the classes to the user?

* Need print & show functions for db.Rquery objects

* May need a realize-in-R function for db.Rquery objects

* Let "conn.id<-" change conn.id for multiple objects together
